# ENVR-400-Herring-Project

###Tens of thousands of tonnes of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) travel from offshore to nearshore habitats each year in the late winter to spawn. Over the decade, there has been a decline in the herring population, which provided opportunity for restoration efforts. The objective of this ongoing project is to assess the Pacific herring spawning event in False Creek, Vancouver. False Creek is a section of the Burrard Inlet that was once a thriving and fruitful coastal ecosystem in the center of Vancouver. There are 4 main focuses of this project this year.  

(1) When do herring spawn at Fishermanâ€™s wharf? How much do they spawn?  
(2) What are the best predictors of a spawning event?  
(3) How clean does a net have to be to provide adequate spawning habitat?  
(4) What other species (animals and plants) live on the herring nets?  
 
###Previous studies have discussed that the spawn event for Pacific Herring occurs between early February and Late April. The egg count will be determined from the analysis of the photographs of the nets. The preferred spawning factors of Pacific herring will be determined from the abiotic data collected in our study. Net cleanliness refers to the degree of algal coverage on the net that reduces herring spawning habitat. Other species that occupy the same space include algae, crustaceans, and amphipods will also be observed and noted. This project aims to shape future restoration efforts around False Creek to improve the quality and quantity of the Pacific herring spawning habitat.
